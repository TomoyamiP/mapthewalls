        <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Map The Walls</strong> is a living record of graffiti and
          street art spotted across Tokyo and beyond. The city’s walls, tunnels,
          and back alleys are constantly changing — tags fade, new pieces go up,
          whole buildings disappear overnight. This app tries to keep track of
          that movement before it’s gone.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-3 leading-relaxed">
          The project started as a way to mix tech and curiosity — to notice
          what’s around us, to map it, and to give credit to the people keeping
          visual culture alive outside of galleries. Each marker represents a
          photo someone took when they stopped and looked twice.
        </p>

        <p className="leading-relaxed">
          Built by <strong>TomoyamiP</strong> in Tokyo, this project aims to
          document art that exists in public space: raw, temporary, and
          sometimes gone by the next day.
